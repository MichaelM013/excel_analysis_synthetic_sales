# **ðŸ“Š Uncovering Sales Trends: An Exploratory Analysis of Synthetic Sales Data**
### **Overview**
This project showcases an exploratory analysis of a synthetic sales dataset, designed to simulate transactions across products, regions, sales representatives, and customer segments from 2022 to 2024. The goal was to uncover meaningful trends and actionable insights using Excel-based data analysis techniques, demonstrating core skills applicable to real-world business data scenarios.

### **Project Files**
  - sales_data.csv â€” Raw sales transaction dataset.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis - Sales Region Tables.xlsx â€” Excel workbook featuring pivot tables, formula-based tables, charts, and supporting calculations.
  - Report - Uncovering Sales Trends - An Exploratory Analysis of Synthetic Sales Data.pdf â€” Full written report detailing the methodology, analysis, findings, and recommendations.

### **Key Skills Demonstrated**
  - Data Cleaning and Preparation (Excel formulas, custom ID generation, time-based extraction)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (PivotTables, dynamic formula tables, charts, moving averages)
  - KPI Development (Sales performance metrics, profit margin calculations, effective units sold)
  - Business Insights (Sales rep evaluation, regional performance, product profitability analysis)
  - Reporting and Storytelling (Professional report writing, visualisation, actionable recommendations)

### **Tools Used**
  - Microsoft Excel:
    - PivotTables and PivotCharts
    - SUMIFS, AVERAGE, XLOOKUP, TEXTJOIN, CONCAT, IF formulas
    - Conditional Formatting for anomaly detection
    - Custom calculated fields (e.g., Profit Margins, Average Discount Rates)

### **Key Findings**
  - Top Performers: Eve and David consistently led sales growth from 2023 to 2024.
  - Regional Insights: The East and North regions generated the highest revenues.
  - Product Categories: Food and Clothing outperformed other categories in profitability.
  - Impact of Discounts: Strategic discounting aligned with significant increases in profit.
  - Sales Channels: Online transactions delivered slightly higher margins than retail.
  - Customer Loyalty: Returning customers contributed higher profit margins compared to new customers.

### **Challenges Addressed**
  - Lack of Customer_ID and Transaction_ID fields â†’ adapted analysis to aggregate trends.
  - Randomised profit variables â†’ focused more on revenue stability for performance assessment.
  - Product ID ambiguity â†’ created new composite IDs for better granularity.

### **Future Improvements**
  - Introduce unique Customer and Transaction IDs.
  - Refine data generation to align financial fields more logically.
  - Incorporate customer demographics and richer product metadata.
  - Build predictive models and interactive dashboards.

### **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates a practical, methodical approach to exploratory data analysis, business insight generation, and reporting.
It also reflects strong capabilities in structuring analysis workflows, identifying actionable patterns, and communicating findings clearly to stakeholders.
